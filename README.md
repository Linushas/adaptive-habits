# adaptive-habits
Habit tracker that adapts to the user's progress. Built in AI agent & algorithm's that decreases/increases the target values for each habit depending on activity. Implementing Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to keep the user engaged and "addicted". The goal is to give the user just enough of a challenge to improve, but as low friction as possible to continue.
